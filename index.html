                    <div class="signal-why">
                        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> New capital usually means new headcount, new tools, and new revenue pressure. Fintech and Regtech companies that have recently secured funding are actively looking to scale operations and improve efficiency.

                        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Teams hiring ops = scaling outbound, which means CRM and lead process chaos. Compliance hiring signals regulatory pressure and need for better systems.
